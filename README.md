# Fall-Detection-System
Uses python to access camera feed; analyse it; identify the person, and the bed; detect changes in speed; and make a decision if the person has fallen off the bed.

Make sure you have modules like opencv, numpy, logging, ctypes, serial etc used in the program pre-installed.

NOTE:
This program is just for educational purposes. There is no guarentee that this will work in a actually needed senario. I myself am a new coder, and I am still learning about Python. It is very very vast and infinitely interesting especially with the integration of maths in it. Please let me know of any suggestions.
